# Model Context Protocol (MCP) and Agent to Agent Protocol (A2A)


**Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is an **open standard** that defines how applications can **pass contextual data to large language models (LLMs)**. Think of it as the **USB-C for AI**—a **unified interface** for connecting models with data, tools, and workflows.

### 🔍 Key Points:

* **Purpose:** Standardizes the way LLMs access external context (data/tools).
* **Benefits:**

  * Plug-and-play **pre-built integrations**.
  * **LLM vendor-agnostic** (works across providers).
  * Encourages **secure, infrastructure-controlled** data usage.
* **Use Case:** Helps build **LLM-powered agents and workflows** that need access to dynamic or proprietary data/tools.


## 🧠 Two Ways to Build MCP Servers

The **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** enables applications to send structured context to LLMs. You can build MCP servers in two distinct ways depending on your goals:

---

### 🔹 **1. Using the Official MCP SDK (Low-Level Approach)**

#### ✅ Overview:

This is the **core, low-level** implementation based on the original MCP specification. It gives you **fine-grained control** and is best suited for custom or lightweight use cases.

#### 📦 Features:

* Direct use of MCP primitives
* Fully compliant with the protocol spec
* Minimal dependencies
* Suitable for understanding how MCP works under the hood

#### 📄 Documentation:

[Official MCP](https://mcp.openai.com/docs)
[Github Docs:](https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp)

#### 🧪 Import Example:

```python
from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP
```

---

### 🔸 **2. Using FastMCP (High-Level Framework)**

#### ✅ Overview:

**FastMCP** is a **higher-level framework** built on top of the MCP SDK. It is the **recommended approach** for most real-world applications due to its production-ready features and developer ergonomics.

#### 🚀 Key Benefits:

* Built-in client and server framework
* Auto-generation from OpenAPI
* Auth, testing, and remote server proxying
* Easy integration of tools/resources
* Scaffolding and deployment-ready out of the box
